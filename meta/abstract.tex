\chapter*{Abstract}
Steadily increasing use of computers, programs, websites and mobile applications creates~a~demand for tools and solutions that monitor their operation and analyze user behavior. Those tools support developers in improving the quality of their products and help customers achieve their goals. At the same time, the price of electronic components such~as~sensors is rapidly falling, while the available computing power is increasing. Those factors have enabled the creation of~a~new category of products that interpret and use the signals emitted~by~sensors.

This paper summarizes the current state of development of~a~wide range of monitoring solutions created~by~both academia circles and commercial sectors. It includes examples of frameworks, device and user behavior monitoring tools and mobile sensor applications. Both their form and intended use varies considerably, even in the limited scope of chosen examples. Systematic literature review of scientific publications is conducted~to~assess the progress in research~on~the use of sensors~to~detect human activities. Except for~a~handful of original publications, most of the analyzed research papers approach~a~common problem of detecting the same set of basic activities and attempt~to~achieve an increase in accuracy.

The second part of this document focuses~on~the technique of creating heat maps from user interactions with mobile applications. Creation process of an original heat map tool is described in detail, starting with the design and architecture, going through the implementation and encountered challenges and finishing with tests and release. The final part of this paper describes the evaluation process of the created solution. A~mobile application outfitted with the tool was distributed~to~the group of testers. Collected data was processed into heat maps which were then used~to~identify issues with the application user interface, come up with good design practices and better understand other potential uses of such tool. Conclusions that were based~on~the insight gained into the application usage validate the usefulness of using heat maps~to~visualize user interactions. \\
